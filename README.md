# README

This project is to not only test my understanding of ruby on rails, but also to be able to try to create
a project from scratch, using my available resources when needed(as i am still new, i have to accept that
  i can't have everything memorized and thus need to turn to old projects to fill in the blanks).
This is a 'mock project' from a 'mock client' aka my bruder who is already a programmer, to create a properties manager program with the following stipulations:
  A: admin interface where can add, edit, or delete necessary Things
  B: Ability to add and track properties(history, name, acres, tasks)
  C: Ability to add employees to a property, thus creating an acct for them
  D: Ability to add photos to the properties
  E: history log
  F: notification to the 'admin' depicting whether a task was created or completed
            and when it occured
  g: Notes for tasks/properties

Although some of these may be 'interlapping' things, figured it worked better
to lay them out thusly.

This project will definitely 'stretch' me, as it seems overwhelming in some areas, and
seems to be more than a 'medium' difficulty project to me...especially at my current
level of experience.  However I will strive to complete this task to the best of my
ability as outlined by the 'client', also noting that i should try to stick with
what the client desires, and create what was outlined, rather than trying to 'improve' or 'upgrade'
the project due to it being a more 'future-geared' way, or seeming 'cool' or any other reasons that could
potentially come about.  This is about fulfilling a couple things:
  A: Ability to:
      1: complete a project 'given to me'
      2: ability to break a project down into more manageable parts
      3: not get overwhelmed
      4: test my skills
  B: get more comfortable with ruby on rails
  C: Hopefully be able to 'memorize' or get 'muscle-memory' of using rails
  D: improve understanding of not only rails, but also MVC format(application understanding
    as theoretical understanding is generally pretty easy)
